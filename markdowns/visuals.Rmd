```

## Loading in the Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in this project's repository under the `data` folder as `sr-dataset.cv`. It can be imported into your environment using the following code chunk:

```{r}
 sr.dataset <- read.csv("~/github/university-meat-reduction/data/sr-dataset.csv")
```

## Comparing Success Rates Across the Three Identified Approaches

```{r}
ggplot(sr.dataset,aes(x=approach,y=effect.dir,fill=effect.dir))
```


## Comparing Effect Estimates Across the Three Identified Approaches

```{r}

```


## Forest Plot

The fixed effect model used for our meta-analysis was restricted to the 17 interventions that utilized observational methods to evaluate changes in meat consumption.

```{r}
ggplot(sr.dataset,aes(x=effect.mag,y=study.title,color=approach)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin=lower.ci,xmax=higher.ci),color="black",width=.2,size=.3) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
